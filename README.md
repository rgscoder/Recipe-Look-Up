By the end of class everyday, I always find myself incredibly hungry but I never know what I want to eat.
I usually scroll through grubhub looking for something close by to pick up, but lately I've been craving 
something home cooked. This inspired me to make an app that displays different recipes based on what ever food I am craving. 

One of the first issues I encountered was finding an API that fit my desired app. I was eventually able to
find one, and began hand drawing a wireframe for the basic layout.

Sites I used: 
           API: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api

           Troubleshooting: https://dev.to/olenadrugalya/ways-of-getting-data-from-api-in-react-2kpf

            Packs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios

Technologies used:
                    Axios
                    REACT
                    Hooks- useState
                    functional components

Install instructions: Clone repository -> npm start (npm pack required) -> enter text -> click enter button on keyboard -> click on a recipe -> to close click anywhere

Issues: I was not able to get the modal to stop displaying when the mouse is clicked outside of the modal. I 
will continue to work on this feature. 

Future additions: I would like to add a navigation bar, a save recipe option, and an add a recipe option.
